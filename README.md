### Resources File
In Robot Framework, a resource file is a file that contains reusable keywords, variables, and other settings that can be used across multiple test cases or test suites.
We write a resources file in the `Resources` directory.

### Running Tests

   ```bash
   python -m robot -d results tests/authentication/Login.robot
   
2. Execute the all sample test:

3. Explore and modify the existing test cases in the `Tests` directory.

### See All Report Tests
You can see a report test in the `Results` directory with name file `report.html`
